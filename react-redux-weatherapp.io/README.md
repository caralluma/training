## Issues

1. React PropTypes have been abstracted to it's own npm package
  * The console in development will show an error
  * Warning: Accessing PropTypes via the main React package is deprecated. Use the prop-types package from npm instead.
  * PropTypes within use the correct prop-types package
  * The React-Toolbox dependency is in the process of updating, see [issue #1410](https://github.com/react-toolbox/react-toolbox/issues/1410)
